    // By default, WebViews dynamically instantiate renderer processes each
    // time a new navigation request is made.  This is known as the
    // "process-per-site-instance" model.  For more information, please refer
    // to this document:
    // https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/design-documents/process-models
    // The command-line arguments described on that page will also work on
    // blpwtk2-based applications.
    //
    // However, in order to provide better control to some applications, the
    // 'affinity' parameter allows each WebView to be constructed to have
    // affinity to a particular renderer process.
    //
    // If 'affinity' is 'blpwtk2::Constants::ANY_OUT_OF_PROCESS_RENDERER'
    // (which is the default if 'setRendererAffinity' is not called), then the
    // upstream chromium logic will be used.
    //
    // If 'affinity' is 'blpwtk2::Constants::IN_PROCESS_RENDERER', then the
    // WebView will be rendered in-process (either on the application's main
    // thread, or a background thread, depending on the ThreadMode selected
    // during startup - see blpwtk2_toolkit.h for an explanation about thread
    // modes).
    //
    // If 'affinity' is any positive number, then the WebView will use that
    // particular (out-of-process) renderer process.
    //
    // Note that if 'affinity' is not 'ANY_OUT_OF_PROCESS_RENDERER', then the
    // application is responsible for ensuring that WebViews that need to talk
    // to each other via script are routed to the same renderer process.
    //
    // Also note that if '--single-process' is specified on the windows command
    // line, then all WebViews will be routed to 'IN_PROCESS_RENDERER',
    // regardless of the 'affinity' setting.  This is useful for debugging.

    // default, the profile is null.  This makes blpwtk2 use the default

    // Note that right now, WebViews with affinity to a particular process
    // (i.e. if 'rendererAffinity()' is not 'ANY_OUT_OF_PROCESS_RENDERER') must
    // use the same profile.  In other words, it is undefined behavior to
